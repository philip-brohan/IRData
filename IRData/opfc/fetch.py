def fetch(variable, dtime, model="global"):
    """Get data for for one month, from MASS. You can specify a variable, for consistency with related functions for other sources, but it gets all the supported variables because they are all in the same file on tape.

     As this function gets data from tape, it may take a long time (many minutes) to return.

     Data wil be stored locally in directory $SCRATCH/opfc, to be retrieved by :func:`load`. If the local file that would be produced already exists, this function does nothing.

     Args:
         variable (:obj:`str`): Variable to fetch (e.g. 'prmsl').
         dtime (:obj:`datetime.datetime`): Date and time to get data for.
         model (:obj:`str`): Which forecast model to use (currently must be 'global').

    Batches retrievals by the calendar month. If you specify a dtime very close to the start or end of a month, it will do the retrieval for the previous or next month as well (so it provides enough data to interpolate the field at exactly the time requested.

     Raises:
         StandardError: If variable is not a supported value, or if the requested data is not available on tape, or if the MASS system is down, or if the model requested is not supported.
