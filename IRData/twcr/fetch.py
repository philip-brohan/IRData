    """Get data for one variable, from the 20CR archive at NERSC.

    Data wil be stored locally in directory $SCRATCH/20CR, to be retrieved by :func:`load`. If the local file that would be produced already exists, this function does nothing.

    Args:
        variable (:obj:`str`): Variable to fetch (e.g. 'prmsl').
        dtime (:obj:`datetime.datetime`): Date and time to get data for.
        height (:obj:`int`): Height above ground (m) for 3d variables. Only used in v3. Variable must be in 20CR output at that exact height (no interpolation). Defaults to None - appropriate for 2d variables.
        level (:obj:`int`): Pressure level (hPa) for 3d variables. Only used in v3. Variable must be in 20CR output at that exact pressure level (no interpolation). Defaults to None - appropriate for 2d variables.
        ilevel (:obj:`int`): Isentropic level (K) for 3d variables. Only used in v3. Variable must be in 20CR output at that exact pressure level (no interpolation). Defaults to None - appropriate for 2d variables.
        version (:obj:`str`): 20CR version to retrieve data for.
        user (:obj:`str`): NERSC userid to use in retrieval. Only needed for v3-preliminary data. Defaults to 'pbrohan'. This should be your NERSC username.

    Raises:
        StandardError: If version is not a supported value.
