    Data wil be stored locally in directory $SCRATCH/20CR, to be retrieved by :func:`load_observations`. If the local files that would be produced already exists, this function does nothing.

    For 20CR version 2c, the data is retrieved in calendar year blocks, and the 'month' and 'day' arguments are ignored.

        dtime (:obj:`datetime.datetime`): Date and time to get observations for.
        version (:obj:`str`): 20CR version to retrieve data for.
        user (:obj:`str`): NERSC userid to use in retrieval. Only needed for v3-preliminary data. Defaults to 'pbrohan'. This should be your NERSC username.

    Will retrieve the data for the year of the given date-time.
