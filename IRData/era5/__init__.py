This package retrieves and loads data from the `ERA5 reanalysis <https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5>`_.

To retrieve the data, it uses the `ECMWF Public data API <https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/WEBAPI/ECMWF+Web+API+Home>`_. You will need to install a key as described in `the API documentation <https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/WEBAPI/Access+ECMWF+Public+Datasets>`_. Note that this is the same system used by `IRData.cera20c` - the same key will let you use that as well.

Only hourly data is supported (no daily or monthly averages) for 7 surface variables:

* Mean-sea-level pressure: 'mslp'
* 2m air temperature: 'air.2m'
* Precipitation rate: 'prate'
* 10m meridional wind: 'uwnd.10m'
* 10m zonal wind: 'vwnd.10m'
* Sea-surface temperature: 'sst'
* Sea-ice coverage: 'icec'

Data retrieved is stored in directory $SCRATCH/ERA5 - the 'SCRATCH' environment variable must be set. ERA 5 comes in two streams: the 'oper' stream is a single member analysis at highest resolution, and the 'enda' stream is a 10-member ensemble at lower resolution - both are supported.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    import datetime
    import IRData.era5 as era5
    era5.fetch('prate',
               datetime.datetime(2015,3,12),
               stream='enda')

will retrieve precipitation rate data for the selected date. ERA5 data is fetched in one-calendar-month blocks, so this will retrieve data for the whole of March 2015. The retrieval is slow, as the data has to be fetched from MARS at ECMWF, but the retrieval is only run if necessary - if that month's data has been previously fetched and is already on local disc, the fetch command will detect this and return instantly.

Once the data has been fetched, 

.. code-block:: python

    pr=era5.load('prate',
                 datetime.datetime(2015,3,12,15,15),
                 stream='enda')

will then load the precipitation rates at quarter past 3pm on March 12 2015 from the retrieved dataset as a :class:`iris.cube.Cube`. Note that as ERA5 only provides data at hourly or 3-hourly intervals, the value for 3:15pm will be interpolated between the outputs. Also, as ERA5 stream 'enda' is an ensemble dataset, the result will include all 10 ensemble members.
